# TypeScript Project Template Readme

## Overview

This TypeScript project template is designed to kickstart your TypeScript development with proper configuration for the TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`) and Prettier. Below, you'll find a brief explanation of the key configuration files and their purpose.

## Files

### `tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` file contains the configuration settings for the TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`). Here's a breakdown of the key options:

- **target:** Specifies the ECMAScript target version (ESNext in this case).
- **lib:** Defines the libraries to include during compilation (ESNext and DOM).
- **outDir:** Specifies the output directory for compiled files.
- **rootDir:** Indicates the root directory of TypeScript source files.
- **strict:** Enables strict type-checking options.
- **esModuleInterop:** Allows default imports from CommonJS modules.
- **module:** Specifies the module system (ESNext in this case).
- **removeComments:** Removes comments from the generated output.
- **sourceMap:** Generates source map files for better debugging.

### `.prettierrc`

The `.prettierrc` file configures Prettier, a code formatter for maintaining consistent code style. Here's an overview of the configuration options:

- **arrowParens:** Enforces parentheses around a sole arrow function parameter.
- **bracketSameLine:** Ensures multiline object literals have the opening bracket on the same line.
- **bracketSpacing:** Adds spaces between brackets in object literals.
- **endOfLine:** Defines the line ending style (LF).
- **jsxSingleQuote:** Uses single quotes for JSX attributes.
- **printWidth:** Specifies the maximum line length before wrapping.
- **semi:** Omits semicolons at the end of statements.
- **useTabs:** Indents with tabs instead of spaces.
- **trailingComma:** Controls trailing commas in object literals and arrays.
- **tabWidth:** Sets the number of spaces per tab.
- **singleQuote:** Uses single quotes instead of double quotes for strings.
- **htmlWhitespaceSensitivity:** Defines sensitivity to HTML whitespace (strict).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install Prettier:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev prettier
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run TypeScript Compiler (tsc):**
    - To compile TypeScript files, run:
      ```bash
      npx tsc
      ```

2. **Watch Mode:**
    - To run TypeScript Compiler in watch mode, use:
      ```bash
      npx tsc --watch
      ```

3. **Format Code with Prettier:**
    - To format your code using Prettier, run:
      ```bash
      npm run format
      ```

## Additional Notes

- Customize the `tsconfig.json` and `.prettierrc` files based on your project requirements.
- Refer to the official [TypeScript Compiler Options documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) and [Prettier Configuration documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) for more details.

Now your TypeScript project is ready for development with proper TypeScript and Prettier configurations. Happy coding!
